# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a [Resoc image template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itdk) to publish my log on Twitter. Deployed it as part of my [personal templates](https://covers.philippebernard.dev/)

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed making it this first task a meta one. Might do it again tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [My personal templates](https://covers.philippebernard.dev/) and the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/phbernard/philippe-personal-image-engine)
