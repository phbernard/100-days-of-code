# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a [Resoc image template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itdk) to publish my log on Twitter. Deployed it as part of my [personal templates](https://covers.philippebernard.dev/)

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed making this first task a meta one. Might do it again tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [My personal templates](https://covers.philippebernard.dev/) and the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/phbernard/philippe-personal-image-engine)


### Day 1: November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Resoc can now produce templates for Twitter banners.

**Thoughts:** This forced me to refactor some code, which I usually enjoy.

**Link to work:** I updated the [image dev kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itdk)


### Day 2: November 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created my personal Twitter banner. With progress bar and all.

**Thoughts:** That was fun! And I like the result.

**Link to work:** It's in my [personal image engine](https://github.com/phbernard/philippe-personal-image-engine)


### Day 3: November 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: My Twitter banner is updated when I push my 100-days-of-code repo.

**Thoughts:** I went full Pareto here. The code itself was ready in no time, but the GH Action setup has been quite hard.

### Day 4: November 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Update your Twitter banner" tutorial.

**Link to work:** That's markdown on Hashnode... Can't share :(


### Day 5: November 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tutorial! Need a full review, but looks good.

**Thoughts:** I had to do a lot of screenshots. That was not very enjoyable.

**Link to work:** Still can share... but will tomorrow!


### Day 6: November 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Review and published the tutorial. Fixed a couple of things in the itdk.

**Thoughts:** I spend most of the day looking at the stats of the article. Not a great day.

**Link to work:** I commited to [Resocio/resoc](https://github.com/Resocio/resoc)


### Day 7: November 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Play with the Twitter API. No clear goal, just trying it.

**Thoughts:** Steep learning curve! There are a few terms to understand to find one's way in the API and client library.
